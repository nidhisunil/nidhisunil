### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nidhi Sunil Kumar, a graduate student at Columbia University in the Master in Computer Science program. I'm mainly interested in Full Stack Development, but am slowly branching out to Project Management and UI/UX design too. ![giphy (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63041917/141607563-e8dfad91-9a36-45c9-a448-fcaf5bee7093.gif)
